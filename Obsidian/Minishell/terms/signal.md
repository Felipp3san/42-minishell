A **signal** is a **limited form of inter-process communication** in Unix-like systems.
- It notifies a process that a specific event has occurred.
- Signals can be **generated by the system**, the **user**, or **other processes**.
- A process can **handle** a signal, **ignore** it, or **accept the default action** (usually terminate or stop).

Signals are identified by **integers** (e.g., `SIGINT = 2`, `SIGTERM = 15`).
Some signals can be caught/handled (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`), others cannot (`SIGKILL`).

## **Most Common Signals**

| Signal      | Number | Default Action           | How to Trigger                                |     |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **SIGINT**  | 2      | Terminate process        | Press **_Ctrl+C_** in the terminal            |     |
| **SIGQUIT** | 3      | Terminate & dump core    | Press **Ctrl+\\** in the terminal             |     |
| **SIGTERM** | 15     | Terminate process        | `kill <pid>` or system shutdown               |     |
| **SIGHUP**  | 1      | Terminate process        | Close terminal, log out, or `kill -HUP <pid>` |     |
| **SIGKILL** | 9      | Kill process immediately | `kill -9 <pid>` (cannot be caught or ignored) |     |
| **SIGSTOP** | 19     | Stop (pause) process     | `kill -STOP <pid>` or Ctrl+Z (in shell)       |     |
| **SIGCONT** | 18     | Continue stopped process | `kill -CONT <pid>`                            |     |
| **SIGSEGV** | 11     | Core dump                | Segmentation fault (invalid memory access)    |     |
| **SIGPIPE** | 13     | Terminate process        | Writing to a closed pipe or socket            |     |
| **SIGALRM** | 14     | Terminate process        | Timer set by `alarm()` expires                |     |

## **User-triggered Signals**

- **Ctrl+C** → Sends **SIGINT** to the foreground process.
- **Ctrl+**\\ → Sends **SIGQUIT** (usually terminates and creates a core dump).
- **Ctrl+Z** → Sends **SIGSTOP**, which suspends the process.

## Programmatic Signal Sending

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = getpid();  // current process
    kill(pid, SIGINT);     // send SIGINT to self
    printf("Signal sent\n");
    return 0;
}
```
